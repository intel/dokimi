"""Assign each atom a content category, and find the atoms that fight each other.

The categories are the product of two axes — *did the model already have it* (measured)
and *does the artifact's own task need it* (judged) — plus a conflict flag:

============= ============== =================
              needed         not needed
============= ============== =================
new to model  novel_useful   novel_inert
already known known_useful   known_inert
============= ============== =================

with ``scaffolding`` for text that is structure rather than knowledge, and
``harmful_conflicting`` for atoms that contradict another atom or the artifact itself.
That last one is the only category which can make an artifact worse than nothing, so it
is reported first regardless of size.

The known/new axis comes from the measurement, never from asking the model whether it
knew something. The needed/not-needed axis is judged. In the study both axes were judged,
and an independent reviewer agreed with 71.6% of assignments, with the disagreements
concentrated on useful-vs-inert (±3 points) and known-vs-novel (±2); here only the first
of those figures applies, since known/new is read off the paired probes instead.
