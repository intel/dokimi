"""L1 reach probe (guidance_reach.v1): which guidance files a harness actually loads.

The probe never trusts a harness's documented loading rules. It builds a
workspace that holds the repository's guidance files at their real paths, puts
a head token and a tail token in each one, and asks the agent to list every
token it can see:

- ``cwd=.``: started at the repository root, tools disabled (``.`` cannot be a
  guidance directory, so the id never collides with a ``cwd=<dir>`` scenario)
- ``cwd=<dir>``: started in each directory that holds guidance, tools disabled
- ``read=<dir>``: started at the root, told to read one file in ``<dir>`` with
  the read tool and then list tokens (finds lazy, subtree-triggered loading)
- ``shadow=.`` and ``shadow=<dir>`` (only when asked for): as ``cwd=.`` and
  ``read=<dir>``, with the profile's ``guidance.shadow_file`` written, seeded, at
  the root or in ``<dir>`` for that scenario only, to show what it turns off in a
  tree that holds none

A file is ``loaded`` when both tokens are reported, ``truncated`` when only
one is, ``fetched`` when it was reported only after the agent read the file
itself, and ``not_loaded`` otherwise. ``error`` means the scenario gave no usable
answer: it did not start, timed out, exited non-zero, or returned an error result
or no answer.

A symlink is one file, as in a checkout: ``CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md`` gives one
record for ``AGENTS.md`` with ``CLAUDE.md`` as an alias, recreated as a link in
the workspace (a copy of the seeded target where the OS refuses a link). A link
that escapes the tree, dangles or names a directory is listed as ``unresolved``
and not probed.

The workspace is a skeleton: guidance files, one probe file per guidance
directory, and a one-commit git repository. Loading depends on paths and
names, not on the rest of the tree, and a skeleton keeps a blob-less clone
from fetching the whole repository.
