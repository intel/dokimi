# How Intel CI tests dokimi

`.github/workflows/intel-ci.yml` builds dokimi's conda package and wheel in GitHub Actions and tests each one. It needs this directory, the recipe, and `dokimi/pyproject.toml`. It publishes nothing: `release.yml` publishes dokimi to PyPI.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `../conda-recipe/` | The conda recipe, `noarch: python` and built from conda-forge alone. `conda_build_config.yaml` lists the Python versions, and `meta.yaml` skips every platform but Linux. Its version, Python floor, console script and run requirements are checked against `[project]` by `dokimi/tests/test_conda_recipe.py`. |
| `../dokimi/pyproject.toml` | What the wheel is built from. Its Python classifiers list the wheels' Python versions. It names no Operating System, so the wheels follow the recipe's platforms. There is no `[tool.cibuildwheel]`: the wheel is pure Python. |
| `../.github/workflows/intel-ci.yml` | One job reads both matrices. One job per Python version builds and uploads `dokimi Linux Python <version>`, and one builds `dokimi Linux Wheels Python <version>`. Then one job per package tests it. It also runs every Monday on the latest releases; a failed weekly run opens an issue. |
| `../.github/workflows/conda-lock.yml` | Every Monday re-solves `conda-lock/` with `lock.py` and opens or updates one PR, so a conda-forge build that breaks the tests fails that PR alone. |
| `matrix.py` | Reads the platforms and Python versions from the recipe, or with `--system wheel` from `dokimi/pyproject.toml`. A pull request gets the oldest and the newest versions. |
| `build.py` | Builds one Python version: with conda-build, which runs the recipe's own tests unless `--no-test` is given, or with `--system wheel` with `pip wheel`. |
| `hooks.py` | The workflow's test jobs: installs one package into a clean environment with the requirements in `config.yml`, and runs `test.py`. A conda package's environment comes from that Python's lock in `conda-lock/`; it installs the package without dependencies, fails if the lock does not satisfy them, and runs the recipe's tests. A wheel's has only Python from conda-forge and everything else from PyPI, pinned by `dokimi/requirements.lock.txt`. A release tag and the weekly run resolve the latest releases instead, from conda-forge and PyPI. |
| `lock.py` | Writes `conda-lock/linux-64-py<version>.txt` for each Python version the recipe declares: the conda-forge builds that the recipe's run and test requirements and `config.yml`'s test list resolve to, taking only builds at least 7 days old. It solves with py-rattler (`pip install py-rattler`), as conda cannot leave out the newer builds. Each lock's header names its specs, and `dokimi/tests/test_intel_ci_conda_lock.py` fails when they no longer match. |
| `config.yml` | Names the workflow that builds the packages, its artifact names, and what the tests need. |
| `test.py` | Runs dokimi's own test suite, `dokimi/tests`, from the checkout against the installed package. |

`matrix.py` and `build.py` read the build system from the files present. They find the only `pyproject.toml` one directory down, as dokimi's lives in `dokimi/`, and `build.py` builds a pure Python wheel when `pyproject.toml` has no `[tool.cibuildwheel]`. `matrix.py` keeps Linux only, the one platform the workflow has runners for.

**What `test.py` proves.** It prints where `dokimi` was imported from and fails if that is inside the checkout. The suite's `conftest.py` puts the checkout on `sys.path`, so pytest imports `dokimi` first (`-p dokimi`), in every xdist worker too. The suite stays offline, as `dokimi/pyproject.toml` makes it. The suite runs with `dokimi/` as the working directory, so the tests that read `data/` and `docs/` find them there. It also checks that the installed package ships its default data files.

**A pull request into `main`.** Actions builds the oldest and the newest Python versions on Linux, as a conda package and as a wheel, and tests each package in its locked environment. A new conda-forge or PyPI release cannot fail it; the weekly lock refresh PR is where one shows up.

**A push to `main`, a tag, or the weekly run.** Actions builds and tests every declared version: a push in the locked environments, a tag and the weekly run on the latest releases.

**A change to the recipe's requirements or to `config.yml`'s test list** needs its locks re-solved in the same PR: `pip install py-rattler pyyaml`, then `python ci/lock.py`.

To support another Python, add it to `conda-recipe/conda_build_config.yaml` for the conda package and as a classifier in `dokimi/pyproject.toml` for the wheel; nothing else lists versions. Try it locally from a conda base environment with conda-build:

```bash
python ci/matrix.py                           # every platform and Python version
python ci/matrix.py --event pull_request      # what a pull request builds
python ci/build.py --python VERSION --output /tmp/out     # VERSION: one matrix.py lists
python ci/hooks.py --python VERSION --artifacts /tmp/out --work /tmp/hooks
python ci/build.py --system wheel --python VERSION --output /tmp/wheels
python ci/hooks.py --kind wheel --python VERSION --artifacts /tmp/wheels --work /tmp/wheel-hooks
```
